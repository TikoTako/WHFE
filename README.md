<h4>Windows Host File Editor</h4>
<p>Simple standalone-portable text editor that open the hosts file for editing.</br></br>
The program automatically generate a settings file with the window position and size, the checkbox status and the font name/size.</br>
If the checkbox is ticked it save a backup of the original hosts into a backup directory with the current date and time as name and txt as extension.</br>
The settings file and the backup directory are created in the exe path.</p>

<b>TL;DR;</b>

✅ Open the hosts file on program start.</br>
✅ Ask for save on exit only if theres some edit.</br>
✅ Backup the unedited hosts file with "DD-MM-YYYY HH_nn_ss.txt" name format.</br>
✅ Can change font and size (stored in the settings file).</br>
✅ Remember the window size and position (stored in the settings file).</br>
